Handlers
Handlers are executed at the end of the play once all tasks are finished.In Ansible,handlers are typically used to start,reload,and stop services
Sometimes you want to run a task only when a change is made on a machine.For example,you want to restart a service if a task updates the configuration of that service,but not if the configuration is unchanges.
Remember the case when we had to reload the firewalld because we wanted to enable http service? Yes,thats is a perfect example of using handlers.
So basically handlers are tasks that only run when notified
