In server a there is already created user is existing,lets say that user doent have passwd or passwd to be update,then we follow this scenario.
In servera,we have "hdfc" user which require passwd to be created
vim changepass.yaml
---
- name: add or update user password
  hosts: all

  tasks:
          - name: change "hdfc" password
            user:
                    name: hdfc
                    update_password: always
                    password: "{{ newpassword|password_hash('sha512')}}"                 //this syntax should be exact same//
:wq
------------
ansible-playbook  --check changepass.yaml --extra-vars newpassword=abc123
ansible-playbook   changepass.yaml --extra-vars newpassword=abc123
-------
in other server you check 
su - hdfc from ozone user // to check password activated or not//
